5. API endpoints
GET /api/stations
Query params (optional): e.g. search or q for name/code.
Response: list of stations (id, code, name, lat, lng, zone).
GET /api/stations/:id
:id = your internal id or station code (e.g. NDLS).
Response: single station.
GET /api/trains
Query params: number=..., name=... (partial match), and/or from_station_id=...&to_station_id=... (from–to search).
For from–to you need trains that serve both stations; if you don’t have stop_times yet, you can return empty or a simple stub and implement later.
Response: list of trains (id, number, name, type).
GET /api/trains/:id
:id = internal id or train number.
Response: train + full schedule (stop_times with station names and times). If you don’t have stop_times in DB yet, return train + empty schedule and add schedule later.
GET /api/trains/:id/route
Response: route geometry (polyline for map). If not available, return 404. For Phase 1 you can derive a simple polyline from station coordinates (by stop_times order) or return 404 until you have data.
